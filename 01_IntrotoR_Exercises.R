## A- CREATE a numeric vector named s which starts at 20 and ends at 100 in increments of 1 (hint: use seq function)

## B- CREATE a numeric vector named x which is made of the numbers: 10,14,20 (hint: use c())



## C- DETERMINE the length and data type of x and s (hint: use the length() & typeof() functions)



## D- ADD the 80th element of s to the 2nd element of x (hint, use [] & the + sign)



## E- ADD the 82nd element of s to the 2nd element of x - what error do you get and what does it mean?



## F- CHANGE the second element of s to the number 7


## G- DELETE the first element of s


## H- ADD the letter 'a' to the end of the vector x


## I- CHECK the data type of x now. What happened?

#x is now a character vector


## J- REMOVE s and x from your working directory (hint: rm() function or the broomstick)
