## Base R comes with built-in data frames that you can use for practice. For the below exercises, we will be using the data frame iris.
## While iris does not appear as an object in your workspace, you will be able to access it!

## A- How many rows and columns does iris have? (hint: dim )
## B- What type of data do the columns of iris contain? (hint: str )
## C- What are the column names of iris? (hint: names )
## D- HOW many missing values are there within each column of iris? (hint: summary for continuous columns and table with useNA for categorical columns)
## E- What are the min, mean, median and max of the continuous column(s) in iris? (hint: summary )
## F- What are the standard deviations the continuous column(s) in iris? (hint: sd )
## F- GENERATE a frequency table of the column(s) in iris containing categorical data (hint: table)
## G- CALCULATE the means of the first numerical column by groups in the first categorical column
## H- USE a two sample t test to determine if the mean differs by category
## I- RECODE the first continuous column into 0/1 by greater than/equal to or below the median
## J- CONSTRUCT a 2x2 table of this new categorical column with the first categorical column in iris
## K- ARE the factors independent? (hint: summary)
